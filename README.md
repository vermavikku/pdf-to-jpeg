# PDF TO JPEG CONVERSION
I used javaScript code to convert pdf into jpeg and use some library like pdf.min.js and used PHP at server side language to save the converted file.
Initialy it checks if folder is available or not if not then it crate it and saved the converted file into the folder itself.
